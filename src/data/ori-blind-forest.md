partially replayed mid-april 2025 after hollow knight. i originally gave this game a 6.5 and called it better than hollow knight but on replay wow this is a lot worse than i remember. feels painful to control, which is a huge problem for a metroidvania. i hate how the save mechanic works especially with how often you die. the game feels like it operates at 20 fps. so many items are just out of reach and tease you with 'hey you gotta come back here later :)' to the point one of the first upgrades you can get are markers on your map telling you where things are (nice job telling on yourself game.). this game very much feels like it couldve been good given more time.
