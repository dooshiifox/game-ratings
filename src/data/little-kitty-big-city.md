i like playing as kitty. nice exploration game, clearly has a lot of love put in it. i think i got a _little_ sick of it by the end? but i was also going for 100% and progress slowed towards the end so that didnt help lol. played it day after release so naturally a little buggy but nothing game-breaking.
