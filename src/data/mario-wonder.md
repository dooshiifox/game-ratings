i was excited for this game and then played it and remembered its a 2d mario game LOL. i love the concept but mario games just dont engage me very much since youre just... running to the right. for the entire game. and yeah youre finding secrets and powerups and cool enemies and level design along the way but _its just another 2d mario game._ celeste has interesting movement and challenge and varies the gameplay frequently and thats why i like it. mario games... dont. i played 2 levels before stopping because it just didnt interest me at all.
