i replayed this game in mid-april 2025 and enjoyed it far more than my initial playthrough. i think some of that is down to the mods i used (thank you whoever made the mod that saves your geo on death ily) but also me improving in skill. the knight feels okay to control, not terrible but not as good as something like celeste. some bosses i still think are too hard. one day i might make a mod to make the bosses easier + some other QOL things, just to make the game more accessible for folks like me. call it the adventurers edition or something.

initial review was a 4/10, here is what it said:

oh yeah lets lose all your money on death. oh yeah lets intentionally make the savepoint annoyingly far away. oh yeah lets make the bosses really hard. oh yeah lets make healing take 5 years. i do not like this game.
