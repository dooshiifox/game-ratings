very fun. i know its controversial but i love the change from 3 laps of the same course to going between them. makes it a lot more engaging for me and i dont think the intermissions are that bad. i think there shouldve been some tool for finding all the collectibles but it gives me an excuse to work on an interactive map. i like exploring and this game has a lot of it.
