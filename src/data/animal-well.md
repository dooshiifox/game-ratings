Its a pretty good game. i like the platforming and the items you get, and a lot of the puzzles feel good. i also like how you can do infinite height with the bubbles (i learnt that before learning you could shoot them downward lol). i also like a lot of the boss moments. however, the game soured for me towards the end. i hate chase sequences, so the cat section fucking sucked, and i quit at what i assume to be the final boss because fuck that im not doing it a second time. otherwise, yeah, pretty solid.
