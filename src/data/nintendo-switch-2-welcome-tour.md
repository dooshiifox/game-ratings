i understand the vision. its honeslty better to think of this as an experience than as a game; something to encourage young kids to get in to engineering and to get older folks interested in the problem-solving process of the design of the Switch 2. i do think it should've been free with the console but i think it gets more shit than it deserves because people think of it like a game. it's not. it's an educational resource.
