only about 2 chapters in and actually i like this game a lot so far?? like the mini stories are cool and the way the gameplay is varied and theres small quests to get the star thingies is fun. my only gripe so far is that you cant go back to get collectables you missed while playing through the act. i hate when games do that like cause it means you have to re-play content youve already been through. i find it fine in celeste cause theres chapters and you can see yourself having improved from the last time you played each room and can get back to places fast but in a linear and unchallenging game like this its kinda unfun imo.
